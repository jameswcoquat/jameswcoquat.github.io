Why would a 40+ year old Army retiree with 20+ years of experience jump head first into an entirely new field?

Great question! Glutton for punishment? Maybe.

I think my choice stems from childhood dreams of becoming some form of scientist. You see, I was largely a nerd growing up. I could remember anything you put in front of me, with very little exposure to it, almost exactly and vividly as it appeared during its presentation. I marveled at the accomplishments renowned scientists and thoroughly enjoyed studying the world around me and above me. I excelled in competitions, thrived during examinations, and generally loved showing how much I retained when called upon to do so.

Buuuut, I also stayed in a lot of trouble. You see, I absorbed things and finished work faster than most, which left me bored and idle during class. I also moved around a lot and never felt like I fit in. So I acted a fool when not engaged in learning. A more famous, or infamous, result of this behavior led to me spending three quarters of my third grade year studying with the Vice Principle instead of my class.

Throughout school, I did well, even after moving out of my parents' house at 16 and getting into more trouble. Did I mention I attended 5 high schools? Sciences remained a strong draw for me and so I set out to be a chemical engineer in college, full scholarship to boot. That is, until, my know-it-all self couldn't reconcile paying for education I felt I'd already received in high school advanced courses. So I partied instead and ultimately dropped out of college. What a waste! For the next 3 years I cooked in local restaurants and partied. It was great, but it was not a future.

I enlisted in the Army in September 1998 to provide structure to my life, garner some college money (again-doh!), and prove to my family, friends, and self I could contribute to the world in an enduring, positive, and meaningful way. The Army challenged me but also provided for me. I gained friends, family, culture, awareness, and understanding in a broad context that I may have never received otherwise. I earned an Associate's in Aviation Maintenance Management, a Federal Aviation Administration maintenance certification, many military certifications, and my Master's in Business Administration while on active duty.

Toward's the end of my Army journey, I began working higher level organizational positions which required heavy doses of analysis and staffing. It pained me to watch redundancy, replication, silos, and manual processes that folks were not trained or prepared for. I discovered the field of knowledge management and data analytics, subsequently devoting much of my time to improving each organization I landed in. 

Upon retirement, I landed an opportunity to work with a business intelligence organization who just started leveraging artificial intelligence capabilities. One of the first things I recognized was the difficulty the data scientists and customers/product owners had communicating with each other. I jumped headfirst into learning all I could about artificial intelligence, primarily its business applications, and offered my services as a sort of translator. Of course, as I dove further into the material, I could not help but want to better understand the technical aspects of this amazing work. Often, I've felt if I don't learn these depths (albeit never to the degree of our PhD scientists), what business do I have speaking to it all. This made my next action quite obvious. I had to learn data science to better contribute to our efforts.

I guess in closing all has worked out as it should, even if the path was winding and undulating. I love exploring new things, picking things apart, finding and creating value for others. Did I mention I needed something an old, broken guy could do? Several injuries and surgeries later, sitting on a computer is certainly in my wheelhouse as I age! 

But seriously, data science is an awesome opportunity to fulfill a childhood dream of mine while challenging myself to grow and helping others solve tough problems and do great things.
